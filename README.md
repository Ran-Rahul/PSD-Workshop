## Roles And Responsibilites ;
  -Front-End Developer{user interface and experience design}
  -Back-End Developer{Server-side logic and database structure}
  -Database Administrator{creates and organizes course content}

## Project Data:
Creating a project database for a web or mobile application that provides online courses, quizzes, assignments, and feedback involves designing a suitable database schema to store relevant data. Here's an example of a simplified database schema:
Entities and Attributes:
1.	Users:
•	UserID (Primary Key)
•	FirstName
•	LastName
•	Email
•	Password
•	UserType (student, instructor, admin)
2.	Courses:
•	CourseID (Primary Key)
•	Title
•	Description
